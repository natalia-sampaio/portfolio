# About Me

Hi, I'm Natália Andrade, a frontend engineer passionate about crafting elegant, scalable, and maintainable user interfaces. With a strong foundation in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript as well as Vue.js and TypeScript, I specialize in transforming complex ideas into intuitive digital experiences.

## My Journey

My career in tech has been a dynamic evolution from power plant electrical engineering to frontend development. This unique background has honed my analytical skills, problem-solving mindset, meticulous attention to detail and the ability to perform well under pressure—qualities that I bring into every project I work on.

## What I Do

I thrive in collaborative environments, working closely with UX designers and backend engineers to ensure that every interface I build aligns seamlessly with both design and functionality. My expertise includes:

-   Developing and maintaining scalable frontend architectures

-   Creating custom component libraries for consistent UI/UX

-   Implementing modern styling solutions with Tailwind CSS

-   Driving best practices in Vue.js and TypeScript development

Beyond coding, I actively contribute to shaping team workflows by introducing style guides, design patterns, and new technologies that improve efficiency and maintainability.

## How I Work

My approach to development is centered around creating a seamless Developer Experience (DX). I believe that well-structured, maintainable code isn't just about functionality—it’s about ensuring that every developer who interacts with it can understand, extend, and improve it with ease.

-   Clear Documentation: I prioritize writing detailed, yet concise documentation to make onboarding smoother and reduce unnecessary back-and-forth. Whether it's code comments, API specs, or README files, I ensure that everything is well-documented.
-   Consistent Communication: I maintain open and proactive communication with my team, ensuring alignment on implementation details and potential challenges. This avoids misinterpretations and fosters a more collaborative environment.
-   Scalable & Readable Code: I write code that is easy to follow, leveraging well-defined patterns, meaningful naming conventions, and modular design to improve maintainability.
-   Proactive Problem-Solving: Instead of just fixing problems, I identify underlying inefficiencies and propose solutions that improve both performance and DX over time.
-   Automating Repetitive Tasks: I look for ways to streamline development workflows, whether it’s through CLI tools, custom scripts, or improving build processes, so the team can focus on what matters.

By focusing on these principles, I ensure that every project I work on remains scalable, maintainable, and enjoyable for the developers who contribute to it.

## Let’s Connect

I’m always excited to take on new challenges, whether it’s solving intricate frontend problems or building innovative solutions from the ground up. If you’re looking for a frontend engineer who blends technical expertise with a strong collaborative mindset, let’s chat!
