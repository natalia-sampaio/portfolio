# Work for clients

## Introduction

Welcome to my Client Projects section! Here, I showcase projects where I built scalable solutions, improved legacy code, and navigated the constraints of outdated systems to deliver high-quality software.

While I canâ€™t provide live demos due to platform restrictions, these case studies highlight my ability to:

-   Develop custom Vue.js applications tailored to client needs.
-   Refactor and modernize legacy codebases while maintaining stability.
-   Work within tight constraints of outdated systems, improving performance and maintainability.
-   Implement best practices to future-proof projects and ensure scalability.

Each project below demonstrates my problem-solving approach, adaptability, and commitment to building robust software solutions.
